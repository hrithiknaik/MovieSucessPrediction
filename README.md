# MovieSuccessPrediction
This is a project based on machine learning concept and different algorithms. In this project there is a big dataset having different attributes and large number of data. The data is very large that's why it needs to be splitted into small small modules or files and it has an extension .csv 
This project basically predicts gross revenue by various factors . There are various attributes in datasets like name of actor 1, actor 2, actor3, director name, movie year, movie budget,  face number in poster, duration of movie, color of movie, genre of movie, language of movie, imdb score, aspect ratio. After entering all input values  it will encode the data. After encoding, it will apply  algorithms and it will predict the approximate gross revenue of the movie.We have used  random forest algorithm. In this project we have measured  various classification metric using  confusion matrix. Also we have shown statistics of preprocessed data.
That's how prediction of gross revenue will be done in this project.
